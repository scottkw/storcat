# Homebrew SHA256 Validation Issue - StorCat 1.2.0

## üö® Issue Summary

Users may encounter a SHA256 mismatch error when upgrading StorCat to version 1.2.0 via Homebrew. This is a **Homebrew validation bug**, not an issue with the StorCat release itself.

## üîç Error Details

When running `brew upgrade storcat` or `brew install storcat`, users see:

```
Error: scottkw/storcat/storcat: SHA256 mismatch
Expected: 6f9fda6a3420f93d1dfa6a276a4aed2ddb9ebb08fe823dfa76d172a5d84dde80
  Actual: 6f9fda6a3420f93d1dfa6a276a4aed2ddb9ebb08fe823dfa76d172a5d84dde80
    File: /Users/ken/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/28c74cd75b310ff169e3da9ee16f28d56f14e496f6ef416ac96c2f64e860fbac--StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg
To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.
```

**Key Observation**: The "Expected" and "Actual" SHA256 values are **identical**, indicating this is a Homebrew comparison logic bug, not a file integrity issue.

## ‚úÖ Verification

We have confirmed that:

1. **File Integrity is Perfect**: Direct SHA256 verification shows the correct hash
   ```bash
   $ shasum -a 256 StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg
   6f9fda6a3420f93d1dfa6a276a4aed2ddb9ebb08fe823dfa76d172a5d84dde80
   ```

2. **GitHub Release is Valid**: Direct download from GitHub works perfectly
3. **Homebrew Formula is Correct**: The tap configuration and SHA256 values are accurate
4. **Release is Complete**: StorCat 1.2.0 is fully functional with all new features

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Installation (Recommended)

Download and install directly from GitHub releases:

```bash
# Download the ARM64 version (Apple Silicon)
curl -L -o StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg "https://github.com/scottkw/storcat/releases/download/1.2.0/StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg"

# Download the x64 version (Intel)
curl -L -o StorCat-1.2.0.dmg "https://github.com/scottkw/storcat/releases/download/1.2.0/StorCat-1.2.0.dmg"

# Mount and install
open StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg  # or StorCat-1.2.0.dmg for Intel
```

Then drag StorCat.app to your Applications folder as usual.

### Option 2: Homebrew Cache Clearing

Try clearing Homebrew's cache and updating:

```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Clear all caches
brew cleanup --prune=all

# Remove specific cached file if it exists
rm -f "/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/28c74cd75b310ff169e3da9ee16f28d56f14e496f6ef416ac96c2f64e860fbac--StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg"

# Try installing again
brew install storcat
```

### Option 3: Reinstall from Scratch

```bash
# Uninstall current version
brew uninstall storcat

# Clear cache
brew cleanup --prune=all

# Fresh install
brew install storcat
```

## üîß Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
This appears to be a bug in Homebrew's SHA256 validation logic where:
- The file downloads correctly with the proper hash
- Homebrew's comparison function incorrectly reports a mismatch
- Both "Expected" and "Actual" values are identical in the error message

### Affected Versions
- **Homebrew**: Various recent versions
- **StorCat**: Only affects 1.2.0 upgrade/install via Homebrew
- **Platform**: Primarily macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)

### Not Affected
- Direct downloads from GitHub releases
- WinGet installations on Windows  
- Manual installations
- Previous StorCat versions via Homebrew

## üìã Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Verify your architecture**:
   ```bash
   uname -m  # Should show "arm64" or "x86_64"
   ```

2. **Check Homebrew version**:
   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

3. **Verify file integrity manually**:
   ```bash
   # Download directly
   curl -L -o test-storcat.dmg "https://github.com/scottkw/storcat/releases/download/1.2.0/StorCat-1.2.0-arm64.dmg"
   
   # Check hash
   shasum -a 256 test-storcat.dmg
   # Should output: 6f9fda6a3420f93d1dfa6a276a4aed2ddb9ebb08fe823dfa76d172a5d84dde80
   ```

4. **Test direct installation**:
   ```bash
   open test-storcat.dmg
   # Install normally by dragging to Applications
   ```

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Fast, lightweight directory catalog management — Go/Wails delivers 93% smaller binaries and 5x faster search, with full feature parity and now full CLI scriptability.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — show-open-and-output-polish

## Current Position

Phase: 10

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v2.1.0 architectural decisions (from research):**

- Use `stdlib flag.FlagSet` (not Cobra) — 6 subcommands don't justify ~2MB dependency in a size-sensitive binary
- `cli/` package with `Run(args []string, version string) int` entry point — zero Wails runtime imports
- CLI commands instantiate `catalog.NewService()` / `search.NewService()` directly — never through `App`
- Windows: decide between `-windowsconsole` build flag vs `AttachConsole` during Phase 8
- macOS: filter `-psn_*` args before dispatch — one function, applied on all platforms
- [Phase 08]: version passed as parameter to cli.Run() — package main not importable; stdlib flag.FlagSet (not Cobra) locked for binary size
- [Phase 08]: Use -windowsconsole build flag (not AttachConsole) for Windows CLI output — simpler, no runtime complexity
- [Phase 08]: filterMacOSArgs applied universally on all platforms — one function, no-op on Windows/Linux, no build tags needed
- [Phase 09-core-subcommands-create-list-search]: tablewriter v1.1.4 requires builder API (Header/Append/Render) not v0.x SetHeader methods
- [Phase 09-core-subcommands-create-list-search]: Interspersed flag pattern: pre-separate positional from flags to support 'storcat list <dir> --json' ordering
- [Phase 09]: Split-at-first-flag pattern for create command: positional args before first flag, everything after is flags — handles named flags with separate values
- [Phase 09]: stubs.go now contains only runShow/runOpen — list, search, and create commands are fully implemented
- [Phase 10]: Depth semantics: maxDepth=0=root only, maxDepth=1=root+children; depth check at printTree entry skips both print and recursion
- [Phase 10]: pkg/browser promoted to direct dependency after open.go implementation; stubs.go deleted — all 6 CLI subcommands now fully implemented

### Pending Todos

- Decide Windows console approach (`-windowsconsole` vs `AttachConsole`) during Phase 8 planning
- Confirm `storcat list` / `storcat search` default directory behavior (cwd vs config last-used) during Phase 9 planning
- Confirm shell completion is deferred to post-v2.1.0 (document explicitly in Phase 8)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

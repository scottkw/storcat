All builds are code-signed and ready for distribution across platforms.

## üîÑ **Migration Notes**

### From v1.2.2 to v1.2.3
- **No breaking changes** - existing catalogs and settings are fully compatible
- **No user action required** - the update only affects internal engine behavior

- **Automatic Detection:** Runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon without user intervention
- **No Rosetta Required:** Native ARM64 performance on Apple Silicon Macs

## üêõ **Resolved Issues**

| Issue | Description | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Blank Screen | ARM64 builds showed empty window | Fixed with JIT-less V8 mode |
| V8 OOM Errors | Memory allocation failures on Apple Silicon | Resolved with Electron 35 + engine flags |
| Garbled Text | Corrupted content in some builds | Fixed asset loading mechanism |
| Build Size Bloat | Linux ARM64 builds exceeded 4.2GB limit | Fixed circular file inclusion in build config |
| ASAR Errors | Build process failed with "file size too large" | Optimized file patterns to exclude build artifacts |

## üõ† **Technical Details**

### System Requirements
- **macOS:** 10.12 Sierra or later (Universal binary supports Intel x64 and Apple Silicon ARM64)
- **Windows:** Windows 10 or later (x64 and ARM64 support)
- **Linux:** Most modern distributions (AppImage and DEB packages available for x64 and ARM64)
- **Memory:** 4GB RAM recommended
- **Storage:** 200MB available space

### Performance Improvements
